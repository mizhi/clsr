clsr
====

Little project to review algorithms and datastructures in CLSR's _Introduction
to Algorithms_
(http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Thomas-H-Cormen/dp/0262033844
). My ultimate goal is to implement all the algorithms in CLSR and to experiment
with different implementations and languages. This, of course, will take quite a
while.
